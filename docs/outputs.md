## Output Format

The output consists of two aligned sequences printed line-by-line:

* **Green**: matched characters
* **Red**: gaps
* **Cyan**: mismatches

Each output block includes the base range for easier visual indexing.

## Future Improvements

* Add scoring matrix customization (e.g., BLOSUM, PAM).
* Support multi-sequence alignment.
* Allow multiple FASTA entries.
* Export alignment results in standard formats (CLUSTAL, Stockholm).
* Web-based or GUI interface.
