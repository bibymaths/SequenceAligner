## Overview

SequenceAligner is a lightweight C++ tool designed for the comparative alignment of biological sequences. It supports three classic algorithms:

* **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Identifies the longest sequence of characters that appear left-to-right (not necessarily contiguously) in both sequences.
* **Global Alignment (Needleman-Wunsch)**: Finds the best full-length alignment between two sequences using dynamic programming.
* **Local Alignment (Smith-Waterman)**: Identifies the highest scoring local subsequence alignment useful for identifying conserved motifs.

This tool is optimized for command-line use with FASTA inputs and outputs colorful visual feedback.

## Command-Line Usage

### Usage

```bash
./aligner <fasta1> <fasta2> <choice> --mode <mode> --outdir <outdir>
```
where 
- `<fasta1>`: Path to the first FASTA file. 
- `<fasta2>`: Path to the second FASTA file.
- `<choice>`: 
  - `1` for Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
  - `2` for Global Alignment (Needleman-Wunsch)
  - `3` for Local Alignment (Smith-Waterman) 
- `--mode`: `dna` or `protein` (default: `dna`) 
- `--outdir`: Directory to save the output files (default: `./`)
