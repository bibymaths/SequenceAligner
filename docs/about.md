# About This Project

This tool was first written by Abhinav Mishra during a **Biological Computation** course at JUIT, Solan in 2014.  
It has since been revisited, cleaned up, and optimized for modern usage while preserving the core academic principles.

## Features 

- Uses BLOSSUM62 scoring matrix for protein sequences. 
- Uses EDNA scoring matrix for DNA sequences. 
- Supports both global and local alignment algorithms. 
- Handles large sequences efficiently with optimized memory usage.
- Provides colorful visual feedback for better understanding of the alignment process.
